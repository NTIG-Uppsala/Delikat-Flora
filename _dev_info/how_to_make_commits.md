## How to make commits:

- Clone repository to Github Desktop
- Create new “Feature” branch from main
- Open in VS Code
- Fix what you want to test inside Feature branch
- Test Feature branch
- If testing doesn't succeed: go back to step 4
- If testing succeeds: check with the rest of the team members
- Push Feature branch to main
