# How to make commits:

- Clone the repo to Github Desktop  
- Create a new “Feature” branch from main  
- Open in VS Code  
- Fix what you want to test in the Feature branch  
- Test the Feature branch  
- If the test fails: go back to step 4  
- If the test succeeds: check with the rest of the team members  
- Push the Feature branch to main
